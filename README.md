##  API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication via JWT token unless specified otherwise.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user (Public)
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile

### Engineers
- `GET /api/engineers` - Get all engineers (Accessible by: Manager, Engineer)
- `GET /api/engineers/:id/capacity` - Check engineer capacity (Accessible by: Manager)

### Projects
- `GET /api/projects` - Get all projects (Accessible by: Manager, Engineer)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project by ID (Accessible by: Manager, Engineer)
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project (Accessible by: Manager)
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (Accessible by: Manager)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project (Accessible by: Manager)

### Assignments
- `GET /api/assignments` - Get all assignments (Accessible by: Manager, Engineer)
- `POST /api/assignments` - Create new assignment (Accessible by: Manager)
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id` - Update assignment (Accessible by: Manager)
- `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` - Delete assignment (Accessible by: Manager)

##  Authentication and Authorization

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Protected routes require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## ðŸ›  Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload
- `npm run seed` - Seed the database with initial data

##  Development

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Follow the Express.js best practices
- Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling

### Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

### Tools Used:
- **Cursor AI** â€“ Used as the primary coding environment to assist with real-time code suggestions and file generation (models, routes, controllers).
- **ChatGPT** â€“ Used for:
  - Generating boilerplate code for Express.js routes, Mongoose models, and authentication middleware
  - Designing API structures and validating architecture decisions
  - Writing seeding logic and validating `getAvailableCapacity()` & skill-matching logic
  - Debugging errors during early setup of JWT and MongoDB
- **Perplexity AI** â€“ Used for:
  - Researching best practices in structuring fullstack Node.js + React apps
  - Confirming role-based access control logic patterns
  - Clarifying differences between REST conventions for engineers vs managers

### Responsible Usage:
- All AI-generated code was reviewed line-by-line.
- Logic was customized to meet assignment-specific requirements.
- Edge cases and error handling were manually added and tested.
- No code was blindly copy-pasted â€” everything was validated through local testing and logging.

### AI Challenges & Resolutions:
- AI occasionally generated overly generic middleware logic; this was refined manually.
- JWT-related logic required adjustment for multi-role access.
- Frontend form validation needed manual tuning beyond AI output to match React Hook Form + ShadCN standards.
